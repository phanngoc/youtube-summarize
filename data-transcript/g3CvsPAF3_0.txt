a good friend has recently shared that
she's feeling tired like really tired
not I did not get enough sleep tired but
something deeper than that she said she
feels and I'm quoting as if I have lost
my
motivation I call her bre because she's
so clearly dedicated to a job and
conducts herself with professionalism
and and kindness she's a wonderful
parent who cares for her children and
she's very responsible when it gets to
her finance and health she is not alone
in feeling
unmotivated Millennial and gen Z
employees tell me that they feel
uninspired at work some admit that they
just don't
care half of American employees are
currently looking for a different job
think about
that all their employees tell me that
they can't wait to
retire and when I ask about life at home
people say that they struggle with our
finance and health to
you the National Data suggests that
chronic diseases such as diabetes and
heart disease are on the
rise the median American family has only
beat over $5,000 in savings barely
enough to pay next month's rent did
America lose its
motivation well the answer is
no turn not you cannot lose your
motivation because you never owned it in
the first
place motivation and that shouldn't
surprise you isn't your car key or
wallet so what is it
well motivation is not about being
strong it's about being wise let me
explain you may think of motivation as a
muscle thinking Some people have strong
motivation muscles others are weak but
this is not a good metaphor motivation
is knowledge you learn how to be
motivated and so today I would like to
help each of you Ander
become wiser so that you are more
motivated and hence better able to
achieve your goals your dreams your
aspirations and giving what the world
has been throwing at you that might be a
good time to refresh your knowledge to
be motivated you either change the
situation or the way you think about the
situation this is the science in one
sentence you change this
circumstances or the way you think about
the circumstances so if you want to be
more physically active there is no point
in yelling at yourself I yell at you
should walk
more instead I got a
puppy she loves long
walks your journey starts with setting a
goal my friend wanted to be motivated at
work so she identified a project she
wanted to
complete that was a goal and it's a good
motivation strategy goals
pulio the problem my friend identified a
project she wish he had already
completed not something she was looking
forward to
doing have you ever set a goal you wish
you had already completed but had less
interest in actually
completing most go are abandoned because
we want to be the person who has done it
not the person who is currently doing
it when we are excited about doing the
work we are intrinsically
motivated we care about the way almost
as as much as we are looking forward to
the
destination in our research we found
that most goals are
abandoned not because they are not
important okay people actually are not
more likely to adhere to their important
compared to unimportant
goals most goals are abandoned because
people don't enjoy pursuing it your
enjoyment is what predicts whether you
will stick with the
goal so what makes goals
exciting exciting goals are never a
chore or a mean
ever wondered why Chicago diners would
Circle the block for 30 minutes looking
for free
parking but will not think twice before
spending the money they have just saved
on parking on ordering another
cocktail why pay for drinks and not for
parking well we don't like to pay for
parking or shipping students don't like
to study for prerequisite classes be all
because all these are means we don't
like to invest in
means we did a study that showed us just
how much you dislike to invest in means
in our study we auctioned a book for
some people and then we auctioned the
University of Chicago toad bag to other
people the average person was willing to
pay $23 for the book but only $12 for
the toad bag the
catch the toad bed contained the
book and people knew
it why would the people that we beating
on a toad bag that contain a book be
willing to pay
less well we don't like to invest in
means okay so you said a gold that is
intrinsically
motivated you are excited about the way
just as much as you want to reach the
destination a couple of weeks passed and
you have not been doing much
lately it has now been four or six
months and your motivation is on the
decline how do you sustain your
motivation how do you get from here to
there well motivation is going to be
high when we just start on something and
toward the end but it will decline in
the middle we call it the middle problem
my friend might start a project with
much enthusiasm then her motivation will
decline toward the deadline it will pick
up again she will regain a
motivation a few years ago we asked
people who observe the hanuka holiday to
let us know whether they were lighting
the first candle on the first night okay
the second on the second night the third
night so on until the eth night
as you can see most people admitted to
only lighting the candles on the first
and last
nights they were procrastinating in the
middle the
solution make middles
short a monthly exercise goal a weekly
exercise goal even a daily exercise goal
are easier because as the end is near it
is easier to stay motivated if if only
hanuka was just two
nights another problem with middles is
that you're going to experience setbacks
and when experiencing setbacks it is
natural to feel
discouraged one wise solution is to
remove your ego out of the picture it's
not about it when you remove your ego it
is easier to
learn when I was helping my 10-year-old
son win a video game he awarded me the
title a failure
expert I love this
title why am I a failure
expert because I don't mind getting
killed by virtual
monsters he doesn't mind seeing me
getting beaten by virtual monsters so we
can both
learn at walk when you're not quite
killing it remove your ego and you will
be better able to
learn another solution is to seek
discomfort if only
temporarily instead of trying to avoid
it when you seek discomfort
temporarily you realize that you can
grow yourself that discomfort is a sign
of
growth no pain no gain is not just about
the gym it's a general wise motivation
strategy
let me tell you about a study that we
conducted with Chicago's beloved
improvisation Club the Second City we
worked with a their training center
which is where regular people like you
and me go to learn
improvisation we were specifically
interested in one exercise give focus in
this exercise one person gets the center
of stage everybody else is Frozen in
place okay this person is moving around
everybody else is
watching we invited some people to feel
awkward and uncomfortable as they run
through the
exercise others in the contal group were
invited to develop their
skills who was more daring taking the
stage for longer well as you can see it
was the people that we invited to feel
feel
uncomfortable in one wave of classes
asking people to feel uncomfortable
double the time they took
Focus those people were also more daring
for example they were dancing a little
in instead of just walking
around and they also reported they were
growing themselves more compared to
those in the control
group okay but here's the problem you
don't only have one goal for my friend
the challenge was balancing between work
and family now if you have not
experienced the work family conflict you
either don't have a job or that you
forgot that you also have a
family but it is wiser to think about
these goals as balancing each other when
my when realized that doing well at work
makes her better family member she was
more motivated and happier to do
both think about your calls like dishes
around the buet table you can create the
perfect combination it is colorful
delicious well
balanced maybe you
exercise on the way to H work um and um
maybe you listen to an audio book while
you you do
that other
combinations don't work very
well they might feel like a waffle
covered with pasta
sauce if you try to study for the bar
exam while no talking to a friend and
watching TV this is
distractive you need to find the right
combination some people might decide to
pursue one goal at a time this is
unrealistic at least sometimes you can't
wait for retirement to start a family so
look for the right balance and
Harmony some goals let's call them
Temptations should take less warm on
your plate however instead of trying to
push them out of mind it might be wise
to anticipate them in
advance when you anticipate all the
alcohol that will be served here later
today you can better control your
consumption when I anticipate that my
colleague is going to be upset I can
better control my emotion in a heated
debate at work when we anticipate
Temptations we are less tempted when we
get
there in one study when we reminded
employees of all the times they will be
tempted to take office supply for
personal
use they were less likely to do that
compared to those in the control
group anticipating Temptations make you
prepared and hence less tempted all
right what about the person sitting next
to you look at them for a second I will
be waiting
here how can that person help
your friends your family and other
people that you love are critical for
your motivation they are your
Lighthouse and you are also important
for
them let me tell you a love story that
resulted in four Nobel prizes when Marie
met Pier Kiri she did not only meet the
love of her
life she met the person who pushed her
to excel in a work on the theory of
radioactivity and who later insisted
that she will be named on the joint
Nobel Prize that was her first the
second Nobel Prize she won by herself
with no man by her
side the couple had two daughters and
they wanted them to
excel the oldest Iran wanted the Nobel
Prize with her husband as was the
tradition in the kir
family their youngest even by far the
most artistic person in the K family
married someone won the Nobel Prize and
excelled in many other
ways the Kiwi family did not only teach
us about radioactivity they taught us
the importance of feeling supported and
supporting others in pursuing goals in
your life life you walk with other
people maybe together you take care of
your pet you walk in the presence of
other people maybe those are the people
in your gym class or in your boook Club
you hold goals for others they hold goal
for you this might be a good time to say
thank you to the person sitting next to
you I will be waiting
here give them a pat on the shoulder
my friend came to me not only because I
am a motivation scientist but also
because I'm her friend and as such I
wanted her to be
successful you may wonder what happened
to her well she stayed at her job last
time I saw her her smile seemed
bigger she did not find her motivation
she learned how to motivate yourself
and so no America you did not lose your
motivation each of you is working hard
pursuing your dreams balancing the the
different aspects of your life and it is
so important especially in the world we
live in today so when you feel
discouraged when you feel unmotivated
remember motivation is not about being
strong it is about being wise and now we
are all wiser thank
you thanks
